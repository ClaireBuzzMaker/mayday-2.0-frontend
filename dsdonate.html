    <p>A historic protest called Democracy Spring just wrapped up a 10-day march from Philadelphia to DC, followed by thousands from across the country converging on Capitol Hill for a massive series of sit-ins & demonstrations, including celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and Gaby Hoffman.</p>
    <p>Our broken political system is blocking progress on all fronts. This is not a partisan issue. It's literally one of the few issues in American politics where massive majorities across party lines agree on the need for urgent reform! Letâ€™s do something about it.</p>
