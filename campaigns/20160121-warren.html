    <h1>Did you catch it? </h1>
    <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just gave a powerful speech calling upon Congress to fight big money corruption. Not only that, but she referenced a recent MAYDAY.US poll that showed overwhelming bipartisan support for the need to fight the influence of big money in our political system.</p>
    <p>"According to <a href="http://blog.mayday.us/post/129846704150/new-maydayus-poll-voters-of-every-political">a recent poll</a>, Democrats and Republicans both agreed strongly with the idea of citizen funded elections â€“72% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans said yes."</p>
    <p>MAYDAY.US is here to fight, we're here to stay, and we're here to take back our democracy from those who have hijacked it. Watch Senator Warren's full speech and then chip in just $10 or whatever you can spare to keep the momentum going.</p>
