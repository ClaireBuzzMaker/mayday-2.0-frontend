      <h2><strong>Change is happenning at the grassroots.</strong></h2>
      <p>You did it! MAYDAY.US citizens in Missouri got Congressman Lacy Clay to co-sponsor the Government by the People Act! Then Congressman Dan Kildee of Michigan joined, hitting our goal of 35 members of Congress since we launched our campaign!</p>
      <p><strong>Maine and Seattle just passed fundamental reform, and a volunteer just created this video to celebrate more national progress! Watch and share the incredible work volunteers did to move our country closer to reform:</strong></p>

      <p>If we work hard in primaries, we can elect more reformers to outnumber the "old guard" and take back our Republic.<p/> 

<p>Our wins put politicians on notice: support citizen-funded elections, or lose your job.</p>
