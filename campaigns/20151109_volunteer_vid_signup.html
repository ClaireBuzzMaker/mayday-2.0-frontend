      <p>If we work hard in primaries, we can elect more reformers to outnumber the "old guard" and take back our Republic.<p/>
      <p>Our wins put politicians on notice: support citizen-funded elections, or lose your job.</p>
      <p>Join the 2016 fight to elect reformers across the country to fight big money corruption in politics.</p>
      <p>Chip in towards the $100,000 goal or become one of 250 volunteers for the MAYDAY.US comeback campaign.</p></br></br>
