      <h2><strong>Change starts at the grassroots.</strong></h2>
      <p>In 2016, MAYDAY.US will focus on the most important fights between entrenched power and open, democratic elections. We&rsquo;ll fight to elect reformers at all levels of government, bringing &ldquo;netroots&rdquo; people power wherever we go. </p>
      <p><strong>Our first race is in Maryland, in one of the most important congressional races this cycle.</strong></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re backing Jamie Raskin, one of the most effective leaders in Maryland because he consistently puts the people over special interests.</p>
      <p>Jamie is a powerful voice for reform who has spent his entire career fighting to end corruption from big money in politics. He focuses on the people and advocates for a better democracy. A law professor at American University, Jamie literally wrote the campaign finance reform book about the &ldquo;wealth primary.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>The stakes could not be more clear.</strong> Jamie&rsquo;s donations come from his district voters, the people he&rsquo;s fighting to represent. His main opponent&rsquo;s donations come from investment bankers, Fortune 500 executives, and DC insiders.</p>
      <p>Kathleen Matthews thinks the way to do things is with a well-connected few. She&rsquo;s a corporate lobbyist who represents powerful interests and politics as usual.</p>
      <p>Her Big Money is outpacing Jamie&rsquo;s grassroots campaign. She just outraised him by $200,000, primarily from special interests.</p>
      <p><strong>Help us fight back and elect a leader for reform!</strong></p>
