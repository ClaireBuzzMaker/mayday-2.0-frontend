      <p class="no-top-margin"><strong>Change starts at the grassroots.</strong> In 2016, MAYDAY.US will be a flashmob for democracy, focused on the most important fights between entrenched power and open, democratic elections. We&rsquo;ll work at all levels of elected office and bring &ldquo;netroots&rdquo; people power wherever we go.</p>
      <p><strong>Our first race is in Maryland, in one of the most important congressional races this cycle.</strong></p>
      <p>Jamie Raskin is a powerful voice for reform who has spent his entire career fighting to end corruption from big money in politics. He focuses on the people and advocates for a better democracy: he literally wrote the campaign finance reform book about the &ldquo;money primary.&rdquo; And he has pledged to refuse all campaign contributions from Big Oil, Big Gas, and Big Coal PACs.</p>
      <p><strong>The stakes could not be more clear.</strong> Jamie Raskin&rsquo;s grassroots donations come from his district voters. His main opponent&rsquo;s donations come from investment bankers, Fortune 500 executives, and DC insiders. x</p>
      <p>Kathleen Matthews thinks the way to do things is with a well-connected few. Matthews is a corporate lobbyist who represents powerful interests and politics as usual. Meanwhile, Jamie Raskin has been one of the most effective leaders in Maryland because he puts the people over special interests.</p>
      <p>Now Matthews&rsquo;s big lobbyist money is outpacing Jamie Raskin&rsquo;s grassroots donors: she just outraised him by $200,000, primarily from special interests.</p>
      <p><strong>We&rsquo;re kicking off our campaign to fix this and elect a leader for reform! Be part of the grassroots movement.</strong></p>
