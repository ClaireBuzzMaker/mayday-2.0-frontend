    <h3>Executive Director</h3>
    <p>Mayday is looking to hire an executive director. The ED will be Mayday's chief strategist, devoted first and foremost to upending American reliance on privately-funded elections. We are seeking someone who is strategic, unafraid, works well with others, and is dedicated to the democratic and moral importance of public financing. We are at a crossroads in our organization and in the country, and the Executive Director will first forge and then implement our new strategies.</p>
